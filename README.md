# flutter_randomize

Flutter Randomize is an application that builds random Flutter layouts when the device
is shaken. It also offers customisable maximum depth of the widget tree.

Shake the device to change the layout!

Maximum allowed depth can be changed from the dropdown and layout can also be refreshed with the refresh button.

Flutter Randomize helps everyone from a user who wants to play around with Flutter layouts
to Flutter developers looking for design inspiration (As the design is random, good 
design is not always guaranteed!)

It can construct anywhere from simple layouts like:

To more complicated layouts like:

To unnecessarily complex layouts like:

NOTE: A library for English words is used in this app. Words are randomly retrieved in the layout.
In some cases, unfortunate words/ word pairs may be generated. These are simply by chance and is not
intentional in any way.
